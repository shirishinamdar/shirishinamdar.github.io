# Introduction

This document outlines the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident investigation with respect to major cyber threats. It provides a framework for understanding and responding to various malicious activities, including their indicators, investigative approaches, and potential remediation actions.

# Objective/Purpose

The primary objective of this SOP is to establish a comprehensive and systematic approach to incident investigation, addressing the following key threats:

- Brute Force Attacks
- Malware (Including Ransomware)
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Botnets
- Compromised Accounts
- Data Exfiltration
- Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) Attacks

By following this SOP, security teams can effectively identify, analyze, and respond to these threats, minimizing their impact on the organization's systems and operations.

# Step 1: Initial Reporting and Response

- Gather basic information about the potential incident
- Identify the affected systems, applications, or networks
- Assess the immediate impact and potential risks
- Initiate the incident response process according to established procedures

# Step 2: Information Gathering

- Collect relevant logs and artifacts from various sources
 - System logs (event logs, application logs, etc.)
 - Network logs (firewall logs, proxy logs, etc.)
 - Security solution logs (antivirus, intrusion detection, etc.)
 - User reports or complaints
- Preserve evidence in a forensically sound manner
- Document the chain of custody for collected data

# Step 3: Analysis and Root Cause Identification

- Analyze the collected data to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Correlate events and activities across different data sources
- Reconstruct the attack timeline and sequence of events
- Identify the root cause of the incident
 - Vulnerabilities exploited
 - Initial attack vector
 - Lateral movement techniques
 - Persistence mechanisms

# Step 4: Corrective Actions and Preventive Measures

- Based on the analysis, develop a comprehensive remediation plan
- Implement containment measures to prevent further damage or data loss
- Eradicate the threat by removing malicious components or restoring systems
- Apply necessary patches, updates, or configuration changes
- Implement additional security controls or hardening measures
- Develop preventive measures to mitigate similar incidents in the future

# Step 5: Implementation and Monitoring

- Execute the remediation plan and corrective actions
- Monitor the affected systems and networks for any residual activity
- Validate the effectiveness of the implemented measures
- Conduct regular reviews and audits to ensure ongoing protection
- Document lessons learned and update incident response procedures as needed

# Threat Actors and Investigations

## Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks involve systematically trying all possible combinations of credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts. Common indicators of brute force attacks include:

- Large volumes of failed login attempts
- Multiple simultaneous login attempts from different IP addresses
- Patterns in usernames or passwords being targeted

Investigate:
- Review authentication logs for unusual activity
- Identify the targeted systems or accounts
- Analyze the source IP addresses and geolocation

Potential Actions:
- Implement account lockout policies
- Deploy brute force protection mechanisms (e.g., CAPTCHA, rate limiting)
- Block suspicious IP addresses or networks

## Malware (Including Ransomware)

Malware, including ransomware, is malicious software designed to disrupt systems, steal data, or extort money from victims. Indicators of malware infections can include:

- Bursts of file update logs
- Antivirus alerts or connections to suspicious IPs
- Unusual system behavior or performance issues

For ransomware specifically, users may report seeing ransom notes or encrypted files.

Investigate:
- Analyze system logs and network traffic
- Identify the initial infection vector (e.g., phishing email, drive-by download)
- Collect and analyze malware samples for further analysis

Potential Actions:
- Isolate and quarantine infected systems
- Deploy endpoint protection and response (EPR) tools
- Implement regular backups and data recovery procedures

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, targeted attacks carried out by highly skilled adversaries, often nation-state actors or well-funded cybercriminal groups. APTs are characterized by their persistence, advanced techniques, and specific objectives, such as data exfiltration or sabotage.

Indicators of APT activity may include:
- Unusual network traffic patterns
- Suspicious system modifications or configuration changes
- Presence of remote access tools or backdoors
- Lateral movement within the network

Investigate:
- Perform in-depth log analysis across multiple sources
- Conduct network traffic analysis and behavioral monitoring
- Leverage threat intelligence to identify known APT indicators
- Collaborate with external security agencies or research organizations

Potential Actions:
- Implement robust security controls and monitoring mechanisms
- Enhance incident response and forensic capabilities
- Regularly update and patch systems and applications
- Enforce strict access controls and privileged account management

## Botnets

Botnets are networks of compromised devices, often called "bots," that are controlled by a remote attacker known as a "botmaster." Botnets can be used for various malicious activities, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spam campaigns, or cryptocurrency mining.

Indicators of botnet activity can include:
- Unexplained high network traffic or bandwidth consumption
- Unusual system or application crashes
- Suspicious outbound connections to known botnet command and control (C&C) servers

Investigate:
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies and communication patterns
- Analyze system logs and processes for signs of botnet activity
- Identify the botnet's command and control infrastructure

Potential Actions:
- Isolate and clean infected systems
- Implement network segmentation and traffic filtering
- Deploy anti-botnet solutions and continuous monitoring
- Collaborate with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and security organizations

## Compromised Accounts

Compromised accounts, whether user accounts or privileged accounts, can pose significant risks to an organization's data and systems. Attackers may gain unauthorized access through various methods, such as phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities.

Indicators of compromised accounts may include:
- Unusual login times or locations
- Failed login attempts from unfamiliar IP addresses
- Suspicious account activity or privilege escalation

Investigate:
- Review user account logs and activity logs
- Analyze login patterns and geolocation data
- Identify potential entry points or vulnerabilities exploited

Potential Actions:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts
- Enforce strong password policies and regular password changes
- Monitor and respond to potential account compromises
- Conduct user awareness training on phishing and social engineering tactics

## Data Exfiltration

Data exfiltration refers to the unauthorized transfer of sensitive or confidential data from an organization's systems to an external location. This can be a result of various threats, such as malware infections, compromised accounts, or advanced persistent threats (APTs).

Indicators of data exfiltration may include:
- Unusual patterns of data transfers or network traffic
- Large volumes of data being transmitted unexpectedly
- Connections to known data exfiltration destinations

Investigate:
- Monitor network traffic for anomalous data transfers
- Review logs for suspicious activity or privileged account misuse
- Analyze system configurations and access controls

Potential Actions:
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) solutions
- Enforce strict access controls and data classification policies
- Deploy encryption and secure communication channels
- Regularly audit data access and transfer activities

## Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) Attacks

Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks aim to overwhelm systems or networks with a flood of traffic or requests, rendering them unavailable to legitimate users.

Indicators of DoS/DDoS attacks can include:
- Sudden spikes in network traffic or system resource utilization
- Unexplained system or application crashes
- Slow response times or inaccessibility of services

Investigate:
- Monitor network traffic patterns and anomalies
- Identify the source IP addresses or networks involved
- Analyze system logs for signs of resource exhaustion

Potential Actions:
- Implement DDoS mitigation solutions (e.g., load balancing, traffic filtering)
- Collaborate with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and security organizations
- Establish incident response plans and communication protocols
- Regularly test and update DDoS mitigation strategies

# Conclusion

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a comprehensive framework for investigating and responding to various cyber threats, including brute force attacks, malware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), botnets, compromised accounts, data exfiltration, and denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks.

By following the outlined procedures and leveraging SIEM and SOAR tools, security teams can effectively identify, analyze, and mitigate these threats, minimizing their impact on the organization's systems and operations. Regular review and updates to this SOP are recommended to ensure alignment with evolving threat landscapes and best practices.

# Continuous Improvement and Training

To maintain an effective incident response capability, it is crucial to continuously improve and enhance the skills and knowledge of the security team members. Regular training sessions should be conducted to familiarize analysts with the latest threat trends, investigative techniques, and the proper utilization of SIEM and SOAR tools.

Additionally, periodic tabletop exercises and simulations should be organized to test the team's readiness and validate the effectiveness of the incident response processes outlined in this SOP. These exercises can help identify potential gaps or areas for improvement, leading to refinements in the procedures and better preparedness for real-world incidents.

# Collaboration and Information Sharing

Effective incident response often requires collaboration and information sharing with external entities, such as industry peers, security research organizations, and relevant government agencies. Establishing trusted partnerships and participating in information-sharing communities can provide valuable insights into emerging threats, best practices, and collective defense strategies.

Furthermore, contributing to open-source threat intelligence repositories and sharing relevant indicators of compromise (IoCs), analysis reports, and lessons learned can benefit the broader cybersecurity community and enhance the overall resilience against cyber threats.
